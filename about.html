                <p><strong>toolsTree</strong> was born from a simple observation: the free online tools we use every day could be so much better. They could be faster, more powerful, and offer more features without compromising on user experience. Our mission is to build that collection of smarter, feature-packed utilities that respect your privacy and help you get your work done efficiently.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-tt-primary">The Journey</h2>
                <p>My journey into development started as a student at the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela. While there, I found myself more passionate about building practical solutions and real-world projects than I was about completing a formal degree. I saw a gap between the basic, ad-cluttered tools available online and what was truly possible with modern web technology.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">So, I took a leap of faith to dedicate myself full-time to creating `toolsTree`. This project is the result of that passionâ€”a solo endeavor to build the most advanced versions of the tools you rely on.</p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> We are currently focused on tools that perform all processing in your browser. This means your data never touches our servers. It's fast, secure, and completely private.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Features:</strong> We don't just replicate existing tools; we enhance them. Our goal is to offer the most feature-packed utilities you can find.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean & Fast:</strong> A great tool should be a pleasure to use. We prioritize a clean, intuitive interface and fast performance on all devices.</li>
                </ul>
